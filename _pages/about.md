I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [group of Maksym Serbyn](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/serbyn-group/) at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria.
My research interests are around variational quantum algorithms and quantum information. I'm also interested in quantum inspired methods and tools from topological data analysis. 

I received my PhD in Physics at the [Institue of Science and Technology Austria](https://ist.ac.at), under the supervision of Maksym Serbyn. Previously to that, I pursued both my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Physics at [Instituto Balseiro](https:://ib.edu.ar) in San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina.
