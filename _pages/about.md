Until recently, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [group of Maksym Serbyn](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/serbyn-group/) at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria.
My research centered around variational quantum algorithms and quantum information. I'm also interested in quantum inspired methods and tools from topological data analysis.

I received my PhD in Physics at the [Institue of Science and Technology Austria](https://ist.ac.at), under the supervision of Maksym Serbyn. Previously to that, I pursued both my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Physics at [Instituto Balseiro](https://ib.edu.ar) in San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina.
